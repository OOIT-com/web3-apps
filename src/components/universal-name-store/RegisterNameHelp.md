# Help for Registering a Universal Name

## What names can I register?

- Personal account or contract names
- Registration costs approximately $1
- Names must be unique and not previously registered
- Only certain characters are allowed

## What character restrictions apply?

- Names cannot start or end with a period (.) or hyphen (-)
- Allowed characters: uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), or periods (.)
- For convenience, names may be display and entered with lower case letters. But the registered name is in upper case.
